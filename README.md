Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. I The students was given the instructions bellow and my review was done in the anagram.py file, atlernatively my answer to the task is found in the Python Task.py file.<br>
<br>
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.<br>
<br>
