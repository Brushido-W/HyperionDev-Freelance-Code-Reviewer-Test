# HyperionDev-Freelance-Code-Reviewer-Test

This is a repository for the HyperionDev Code Reviewer position that consists of 4 sections.

## Section A: Code Review
In this section I will present my review on a hypothetical student sumbissions by commenting on:<br>
1. Correctness
2. Efficiency
3. Style
4. Documentation
<br>
I have also commented on the postive aspects and improvements that are necessary for the students.

Option 1: Python Task<br>
<br>
I have seleceted the first option which is in python to do my review.
The students was given the instructions bellow and my review was done in the anagram.py file, atlernatively my answer to the task is found in the Python Task.py file.<br><br>
In a file called anagram.py, create:<br>
<br>
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together.<br>
<br>
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
<ul><li>You can return the answer in any order.</li>
<li>Strings consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Example input
<ul><li>Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]</li>
<li>Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]</li>
</ul>
