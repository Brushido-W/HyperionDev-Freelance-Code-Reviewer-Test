Instructions and scripts necessary to build, test and run
----------------------------------------------------------

For this task you will NumberFormat Script operation. To install this script your will simply 
use java import keyword which is used to access package and its classes into the java program. 

You will use the code; “import java.text.NumberFormat;” complete this task.
Next you will need to fun this code and check for any errors, if you receive a error that 
states “No ‘public class’ found to execute” you have successfully imported your script. 

The reason it gives this error is because the built-in package refers to a class that is in 
another package by directly using its name. from here you will need to create your class, 
which for this program it is going to be “public class SayTheNumber {}”.

From here you are going to create main method in the class SayTheNumber and you will do this 
by defining the main method as: public static void main(String[] args). For this task you 
will also need to use the “public static final String[]” to store constant values. 
Since we are required to include a test suite for your solution, we will firstly declare n 
as an integer and further go onto print each of the input values.

Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs. 
That means how much memory, in the worst case, is needed at any point in the algorithm. 
Given the size of n can be any value from 0 to 999,999,999,999,999 the running time and 
memory can be greatly affected by the input but the opposite is true if the value of n is 
any value less than 10.
